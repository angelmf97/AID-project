AID project

The idea of this project (if nothing changes) is developing a system that adjusts music playback speed to match a jogger's pace. We explore the possibility of enhancing the joggers' experience by developing a pace-setter running app with two modes:
* __Joy Ride__: uses accelerometers to detect running pace and adapt music's playback speed real-time to match with current pace.
* __Pace Setter__: uses heart rate and accelerometers, finds optimal running pace and adapts song speed real-time to help you reach it.
\end{itemize}
